# Rest-API-Basics

**Day 1 Rest API Basics**
Understanding API
**What is an API ?​**
API stands for Application Programming Interface.​
Imagine you’re at a restaurant:
You are the customer.​
The kitchen is the system that prepares your food.​
The waiter is the API.​

​**Real Life Example​**:
You look at a menu and say, “I want butter chicken.”​
The waiter takes your order to the kitchen.​
The kitchen prepares the food and gives it to the waiter.​
The waiter brings the food back to you.​
➡️ You never talk directly to the kitchen. You talk to the waiter (API).​

**Technical Example:**​
Let’s say you’re using a mobile app to check the weather:​
You (User) tap “Check Weather.”​
The app sends a request via an API to the weather service.​
The weather service (like a kitchen) prepares the data (temperature, forecast).​
The API (waiter) brings that data back to your phone.​
✅ You get to see the weather in seconds — without needing to know how it works behind the scenes.​

**Key HTTP Methods (Use Like a Pro)​**
GET: Fetches list of users
POST: Creates a new user
PUT: Updates whole data record
DELETE: Removes user by ID
PATCH: Updates user partially

**JSON: The API Language​**
JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is the standard API data format.​
Why?​
1) Key-value based: simple to understand. Label the actual data. We write what we think. JSON readable both for humans and machines​
2) Lightweight and easy to parse: JSON is small in size, uses less data, and is fast to send/receive over the internet.​
3) Language-independent: JSON can be understood and used by almost any programming language.​

#Endpoint Methods Used
**GET- Used to fetch/retrive data
POST- To create new data
PUT- to whole record
PATCH- to update certain records
DELETE- to surgically remove data**
