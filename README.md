# Rest-API-Basics

**Day 1 Rest API Basics**
Understanding API
**What is an API ?‚Äã**
API stands for Application Programming Interface.‚Äã
Imagine you‚Äôre at a restaurant:
You are the customer.‚Äã
The kitchen is the system that prepares your food.‚Äã
The waiter is the API.‚Äã

‚Äã**Real Life Example‚Äã**:
You look at a menu and say, ‚ÄúI want butter chicken.‚Äù‚Äã
The waiter takes your order to the kitchen.‚Äã
The kitchen prepares the food and gives it to the waiter.‚Äã
The waiter brings the food back to you.‚Äã
‚û°Ô∏è You never talk directly to the kitchen. You talk to the waiter (API).‚Äã

**Technical Example:**‚Äã
Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre using a mobile app to check the weather:‚Äã
You (User) tap ‚ÄúCheck Weather.‚Äù‚Äã
The app sends a request via an API to the weather service.‚Äã
The weather service (like a kitchen) prepares the data (temperature, forecast).‚Äã
The API (waiter) brings that data back to your phone.‚Äã
‚úÖ You get to see the weather in seconds ‚Äî without needing to know how it works behind the scenes.‚Äã

**Key HTTP Methods (Use Like a Pro)‚Äã**
GET: Fetches list of users
POST: Creates a new user
PUT: Updates whole data record
DELETE: Removes user by ID
PATCH: Updates user partially

**JSON: The API Language‚Äã**
JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is the standard API data format.‚Äã
Why?‚Äã
1) Key-value based: simple to understand. Label the actual data. We write what we think. JSON readable both for humans and machines‚Äã
2) Lightweight and easy to parse: JSON is small in size, uses less data, and is fast to send/receive over the internet.‚Äã
3) Language-independent: JSON can be understood and used by almost any programming language.‚Äã
